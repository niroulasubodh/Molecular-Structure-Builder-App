# Molecular-Structure-Builder-App
This Python application leverages Streamlit to create a web interface that converts SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation into interactive molecular visualizations. Users can input SMILES strings to generate both 2D and 3D molecular structures. The app displays a static 2D representation alongside an interactive 3D model that can be rotated and zoomed. Built with RDKit for molecular processing and py3Dmol for 3D visualization, the app includes a list of example molecules for easy testing.
